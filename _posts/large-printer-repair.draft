This is all done on the Mutoh ValueJet 1204AS we use in one of our businesses.  The print feed motor failed, and for good measure, we intended to replace the print feed motor's encoder (which provides feedback to the machine about the movement the motor generates).

So I did all this earlier today, pausing only to shoot pictures for the blog (and just in case I had to show a real technician what I had done to it later).  Naturally this is pretty scary because the machine way expensive to repair or replace.  But it went really well.

Next I plan to try some home surgery.  There's a kit for that called "Suture Self".  (thanks to my dad for telling me that joke when I was a kid)
