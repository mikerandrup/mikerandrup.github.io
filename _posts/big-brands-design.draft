Over the years, they have printed banners promoting quite a few national brands.  The idea for a poster to show the diverse group of companies seemed natural.
The first task was gathering logo files.  Most of them were possible to take from the original banner artwork, but a few needed to be picked up from <a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/">www.BrandsOfTheWorld.com</a> as vector files.  Each logo is superimposed on a small "virtual banner", which I created in Photoshop back in 2008 as part of the BargainBanners.com logo.  The background contains a lovely US Map and "light steaks" courtesy of VectorStock.com.  Everything was assembled in InDesign, and output to a PDF for the poster printing.
The finished piece is 4 feet wide by about 3 feet tall, and is now hanging in their banner workshop.
